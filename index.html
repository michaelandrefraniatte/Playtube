                <p>
                    <b>T</b>he folder of the program contains a colors text file for customize it. You can remove a video easy, because when you click on a picture, it copy in clipboard, the picture link containing the video id or with the best and last version, using Microsoft Webview2, directly the video id. Also, you can open a video in your favorite browser or simply copy picture link. You can add without any limit. You only need to accept Youtube RGPD once and then restart the program. You can try the web version of <a href="../playtube/">playtube</a>. I also made the Edge extension named playtube-extension. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank" href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. It's made to use on top of Youtube like the program (i.e. opening the extension when your web browser is on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>). You can try my gallery by opening the <a href="playtube.txt" download class="dl-link">example</a> containing my playlists. Take care to always open the extension under same site because it use localstorage for saving the gallery (localstorage info). I made the Edge extension named localstorage-info-extension. When you let a few times the cursor on buttons, you can see information bubbles, explaining the use of it. This <a href="channel-id.txt" download class="dl-link">file</a> is explaining the way to get playlist id and channel id, in order to add videos in a playlist using a Youtube data API key. Also, this <a href="playlist-id.txt" download class="dl-link">file</a> containing the id for my example of playlists allowing me to update it. My gallery example isn't compatible with the program, but I can convert it for you. With the extension, you can add several videos in a raw using several id of video, channel and playlist in the prompt line by separating with white space. The same for removing video in a playlist with several id of video separate with white space. This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zvduVAqo">video</a> can help you to create your Youtube data API key. You can test the process with <a target="_blank" href="../Listing-Videos">Listing Videos</a>. To note, with the Edge extension and program, you can have visualization of audio frequencies by enabling Stereo Mixer, with level to 100 and without listening a peripheral, and disabling microphone from audio settings under Windows parameters. You also must allow Youtube access your microphone (audio input with Stereo Mixer) under Edge. If you want to create a new list of playlists, simply open a empty file. I can create for you, playlist files to import. To note, the key F11, under Edge, is used to have the window page in fullscreen. Also, with the extension, you can control using your microphone (enabling it in Playtube, and instead of Stereo Mixer) with previous, next, all random, random, loop, straight, voice commands the corresponding actions and states. You can also ear title of playlist and title of video, each time it load one. There are bugs if using & in playlist names, like not allowing to put it in bold and italic when entering it, so don't use & in playlist names. Also, localstorage can be corrupted after updates of Microsoft or Youtube, making the buttons not appearing, but you can solve the issue by deleting cookies under Edge parameters. By the what, you need to disable security enforcement for Youtube from padlock at left of browsing bar and delete cookies not appearing as Youtube site or Google. It comes with another program, if you have a laptop PC and Bluetooth speakers, to enable both. There's a parameters file under same folder of the program if you have a error message, it need to set the parameter to True or False, it's made if first device is the capture device. To note, it ask to set a audio quality of 16 bits and 44100 Hz format for both audio cards, and enable both material acceleration and enhanced audio, under audio settings, but there's also another parameter to disable the program to not automatically launching.
